# Genome annotation and comparative genomics, part 2

This repository contains the course materials for the workshop Genome annotation and comparative genomics, part 2 created for the Oslo Bioinformatics Workshop Week 2023 and taught by people in the EBP-Nor project. The course is run on infrastructure provdided by [Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/).

You can find part 1 [here](https://github.com/ebp-nor/workshop-2024/day2_genome_annotation). You should be able to follow this workshop independently of part 1, but it might give some background that is useful.


This workshop is sponsored by [EBP-Nor](https://www.ebpnor.org/), [Norbis](https://norbis.w.uib.no/) and [Elixir](https://elixir.no/).
