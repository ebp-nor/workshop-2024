# Genome annotation and comparative genomics, part 2

This repository contains the course materials for the workshop Genome annotation and comparative genomics, part 2 created for the Oslo Bioinformatics Workshop Week 2023 and taught by people in the EBP-Nor project. The course is run on infrastructure provided by the University of Oslo. 

You can find part 1 [here](https://github.com/ebp-nor/genome_annotation_comparative_genomics_part1). You should be able to follow this workshop independently of part 1, but it might give some background that is useful.

This workshop is sponsored by EBP-Nor in addition to the sponsors for the Oslo Bioinformatics Workshop Week 2023 itself.
